# Life Treadmills (LTR) - Hackathon One Pager

## One-Line Pitch
LTR is a Life OS that turns personal context into the next executable quest, so users do not waste energy deciding what to do.

## Problem
People fail goals less from weak willpower and more from decision fatigue. Repeated micro-decisions increase stress, lower consistency, and push users toward easy avoidance.

## Core Thesis
Performance starts when unnecessary decisions are removed.
AI handles interpretation and path calculation.
Humans focus on execution, experience, and meaning.

## Product Mission
Build Pathfinder OS: a multimodal life agent that ingests user context and outputs real-time, adaptive action plans.

## 3-Layer System
1. Context Layer
- Multimodal vault: text, voice, image, video, behavior logs.
- Signals: energy, constraints, failure patterns, routine windows, completion history.

2. Think Layer
- Gemini reasoning engine analyzes short-term state + long-term trend.
- Dynamic tech-tree updates path to the goal.
- Recovery logic transforms failure into rerouting data.

3. Action Layer
- Widget-based daily dashboard.
- One main quest, fallback quest, execution timing, and immediate recovery actions.

## What Makes LTR Different
- Goal apps: reminders only.
- LTR: context-aware routing with adaptive recovery.
- Failure in common apps: reset.
- Failure in LTR: data for route correction.
- Generic advice vs personalized next step based on real context.

## MVP Scope (2-3 Day Hackathon)
Day 1
- Onboarding with 5 critical questions.
- Initial tech-tree generation with Gemini.
- Daily dashboard with quest execution loop.

Day 2
- Quest complete/fail input.
- Recovery quest generation on fail.
- Tech-tree update after each decision.

Day 3
- Future Self Visualizer (Imagen).
- Voice check-in capture.
- 3-day journey recap.

## Demo Story (3 Minutes)
- Open day dashboard and show today's quest.
- Submit failure voice check-in.
- Show Gemini reasoning + fallback quest.
- Show tech-tree reroute animation.
- Generate future-self visual and close with projected goal date.

## Judge-Facing Value
- Long-context personalization.
- Multimodal reasoning.
- Real-time adaptive loop.
- Explainable quest decisions.
- Emotional engagement via future-self visualization.
