# LTR 3-Minute Demo Script

## 0:00-0:25 - Hook
"People do not fail because they are lazy. They fail because they face too many decisions. LTR removes those decisions and gives one executable next step."

## 0:25-0:55 - Context Layer
- Open Home.
- Show energy, constraints, and streak signals in the Context widget.
- Say: "LTR reads today's real condition, not just a static goal."

## 0:55-1:30 - Think Layer
- Trigger daily reasoning or show precomputed AI insight.
- Say: "Gemini analyzes history + current context and reroutes the tech-tree in real time."

## 1:30-2:10 - Action Layer + Failure Recovery
- Tap "Start" on today's main quest.
- Simulate fail, then open recovery flow.
- Show fallback quest generated instantly.
- Say: "Failure is not reset. It becomes routing data."

## 2:10-2:40 - Tech-Tree Visualization
- Move to TechTree screen.
- Highlight status transition (locked -> in_progress -> completed).
- Mention explainability: each node has reason and metric.

## 2:40-3:00 - Close
"LTR is not a reminder app. It is a life operating system that converts context into action. We are not tracking goals. We are producing goal attainment."
